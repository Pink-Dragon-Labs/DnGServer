	type fedex

	proposal "Now that you mention it, I could use some assistance.  You see, my tools have been swallowed up by an a huge rat down in the cellar and I need to get them.  I would get them myself, but there are just oodles of other monsters down there.  I just can't stand the sight of blood... I'm petrified, you know.  Could you go down there and get my tools for me?  You can have everything else in that chest down there and I'll throw in this weird bauble another adventurer left on my bar.  What do you say?"

	accepted "Great!  I'm so glad that you can help me out.  Just go down that trap door over there, you can't miss the big bastard!"

	declined "I understand...  It's a task that's probably too difficult for someone like you.  Thanks anyway."

	reminder "Did you get my tools yet?"

	completed "Thank you very much!  You don't know how much this means to me.  Here, have this bauble along with my thanks!!"
