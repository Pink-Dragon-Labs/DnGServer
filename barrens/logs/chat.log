Mon Apr 23 02:32:42 2018: killer:KillerMcCloud:G004: no
Mon Apr 23 02:32:51 2018: killer:KillerMcCloud:G004: less then 1k xp per
Mon Apr 23 02:33:04 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: Not gonna get much better
Mon Apr 23 02:33:34 2018: stone:StoneMcCloud:G004: achren i guess and kill dragons
Mon Apr 23 02:34:25 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: Gonna be roughly the same xp 
Mon Apr 23 02:34:52 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: No where good for hitters past 1k imo
Mon Apr 23 02:35:07 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: Dont do enough damage to make anything worthwhile solo
Mon Apr 23 02:38:59 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: better off lvling wizzies just cause the AoE damage is real good for lvling post 1k
Mon Apr 23 02:40:04 2018: zach:Zach:G004: Im imping northern steppes and crystal mountains

Mon Apr 23 12:03:54 2018: nasty:SoulHunter:G004: found a Rare Magical emerald, never heard of this item before
Mon Apr 23 12:05:12 2018: heed2:DarkOne:G004: me either
Mon Apr 23 12:05:28 2018: nasty:SoulHunter:G004: A magical emerald that is not like the others you have encountered...  This item weighs 0.1 stones.  This is in excellent condition (100%).
Mon Apr 23 12:05:44 2018: heed2:DarkOne:G004: have you use GiD on it yet?
Mon Apr 23 12:05:52 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: It's for a quest
Mon Apr 23 12:06:07 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: You have to find the quest givers
Mon Apr 23 12:06:11 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: they roam around
Mon Apr 23 12:06:24 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: Like the world bosses
Mon Apr 23 12:06:28 2018: nasty:SoulHunter:G004: Some say they are worth nothing, but to some, they are worth everything..  This item weighs 0.1 stones.  This is in excellent condition (100%).
Mon Apr 23 12:06:29 2018: heed2:DarkOne:G004: o right thats actually quite an awesome way to take quests back
Mon Apr 23 12:10:04 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: they dont drop enough imo 
Mon Apr 23 12:10:25 2018: nasty:SoulHunter:G004: found it in fufus chest
Mon Apr 23 12:10:28 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: Only 10 lvls and by the time you track the quest giver down, you could have likely lvled those 10
Mon Apr 23 12:11:46 2018: nasty:SoulHunter:G004: it quest with the magical emerald give 10 lvls instantly?
Mon Apr 23 12:12:57 2018: heed2:DarkOne:G004: would be a good help to post 1k toons
Mon Apr 23 12:13:04 2018: heed2:DarkOne:G004: but as you said more often
Mon Apr 23 12:13:05 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: You give it to the quest giver and I believe he gives you a bauble to use either that or instant 10 lvls, I'm not sure, havent used the ruby I found
Mon Apr 23 12:13:42 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: Would be a good help if you were finding more then 1 every 10 days
Mon Apr 23 12:15:25 2018: heed2:DarkOne:G004: yeh maybe having it 30-40 lvls a week?
Mon Apr 23 12:18:24 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: At the rate ive been finding the gems, I think 100 lvls for one gem would be better
Mon Apr 23 12:19:07 2018: heed2:DarkOne:G004: makes sence
Mon Apr 23 12:19:49 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: I've been grinding lvls for a month now and still am only lvl 1500
Mon Apr 23 12:19:58 2018: heed2:DarkOne:G004: dang

Tue Apr 24 01:59:26 2018: stone:ConorMcCloud:T PyreThief: non shifting 

Tue Apr 24 01:59:37 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:T ConorMcCloud: Meh

Tue Apr 24 02:00:03 2018: stone:ConorMcCloud:T PyreThief: it was killing knioghts faster then my asgw fully geared with a BC lol

Tue Apr 24 02:00:05 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:T ConorMcCloud: Would rather taken redemption on an ASGW

Tue Apr 24 02:00:27 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:T ConorMcCloud: Well dunno why you would be using BC

Tue Apr 24 02:00:40 2018: stone:ConorMcCloud:T PyreThief: because that was all i had

Tue Apr 24 02:00:47 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:T ConorMcCloud: If ya have a Mace of Creation, that beats the pants off BC

Tue Apr 24 02:00:48 2018: stone:ConorMcCloud:T PyreThief: on stone after the change

Tue Apr 24 02:01:12 2018: stone:ConorMcCloud:T PyreThief: mace is 2 or 3 square?

Tue Apr 24 02:01:48 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:T ConorMcCloud: 2 sq, but life steal, acid damage and I think same damage as BC? So works out to be about 30% more dmg cause of life steal and acid

Tue Apr 24 02:02:31 2018: stone:ConorMcCloud:T PyreThief: 115-220 on the mace

Tue Apr 24 02:02:38 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:T ConorMcCloud: Axe of desolation is still pretty dope too, just lacks life steal compared to MoC

Tue Apr 24 02:02:49 2018: stone:ConorMcCloud:T PyreThief: and weighs 30 stone less

Tue Apr 24 02:02:54 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:T ConorMcCloud: Just try the mace out

Tue Apr 24 02:03:01 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:T ConorMcCloud: You'll be pleasantly surprised

Tue Apr 24 02:04:13 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:T ConorMcCloud: Long sword=str/dex

Tue Apr 24 02:30:00 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:T ConorMcCloud: Should see 4.5k with an ASGW

Tue Apr 24 02:30:34 2018: stone:ConorMcCloud:T PyreThief: 3.5k with the claw of destruction on the aegw

Tue Apr 24 02:31:03 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:G004: Better then SoT? Vengeance, you can also use 2 handers, which are str/dex based as well
Tue Apr 24 02:31:19 2018: cod:CoDMachine:G004: yeah vengeance is too heavy

Tue Apr 24 02:34:00 2018: stone:ConorMcCloud:T PyreThief: most things are 2 range

Tue Apr 24 02:34:15 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:T ConorMcCloud: Theres a 550 Claw

Tue Apr 24 02:34:17 2018: stone:ConorMcCloud:T PyreThief: and movement cancels out hits

Tue Apr 24 02:34:22 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:T ConorMcCloud: Rupture that does 110-225

Tue Apr 24 02:34:25 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:T ConorMcCloud: 2 range

Tue Apr 24 02:34:50 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:T ConorMcCloud: Can be found in Achren, LW, Anvil and Maze

Tue Apr 24 03:02:20 2018: cod:CoDMachine:G004: because i have been too lazy to change them out
Tue Apr 24 03:02:26 2018: hv0kpgah:JustaDreamer:G004: think the warrior boots give +atk tho
Tue Apr 24 03:03:20 2018: stone:StoneMcCloud:G004: A pair of armored Sabatons worn by only the mightiest of warriors, giving you a buff to your Dexterity, Strength, Endurance while giving you Cold Protection and Fire Protection. 
Tue Apr 24 03:03:25 2018: hv0kpgah:JustaDreamer:G004: The good/evil highs are probably still useful in certain situations
Tue Apr 24 03:04:08 2018: hv0kpgah:JustaDreamer:G004: yea probably still better then the warrior boots then, oh its mage shoes that give the atk lol
Tue Apr 24 03:04:33 2018: cod:CoDMachine:G004: 32/30 with the boots on 
Tue Apr 24 03:05:02 2018: hv0kpgah:JustaDreamer:G004: Getting any decent hits with Desolation?
Tue Apr 24 03:05:24 2018: hv0kpgah:JustaDreamer:G004: Kinda low on str to be using a str based wep, ideal would be str/dex

Tue Apr 24 03:23:31 2018: 52zuosdu:PyreThief:G004: by a huge margin

Tue Apr 24 11:33:43 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: Yea lowering group count means I end up with 3 toons lvled up and no one to take with em
Tue Apr 24 11:33:44 2018: heed2:DarkOne:G004: instead of 6
Tue Apr 24 11:34:07 2018: heed2:DarkOne:G004: make a lvl 1 noob for boost?

Tue Apr 24 21:22:28 2018: 9e097a24:William:G004: and yes, south button in hatchery opens faf's door
Tue Apr 24 21:26:51 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: So one doesnt have to do all of hatchery, just the south wing... nice
Tue Apr 24 21:27:08 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: Save me a good 20 minutes and a handles

Tue Apr 24 21:30:53 2018: 2dmvcqv0:PyresWiz:G004: That Faf chest is cursed. I used to do just hatch and lib on NG, cause it was so disappointing after 2 hours to open a chest and get an iron bar
Tue Apr 24 21:31:06 2018: zach:Zach:G004: lol
Tue Apr 24 21:31:44 2018: 9e097a24:William:G004: good mthing Zach would never allow thatÇ

Fri Apr 27 00:46:12 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: So I was wondering: can you make new NPCs, like the ones in the Pumpkin patch during Halloween/Oktoberfest?

Fri Apr 27 00:46:24 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: Depending on what you mean by new

Fri Apr 27 00:46:27 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: Like, new LOOKING mobs?

Fri Apr 27 00:46:48 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: Or just old recycled mobs changed up

Fri Apr 27 00:47:03 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: New: new looking, new interactions... like, for being able to set up quests/turn-ins.

Fri Apr 27 00:47:51 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: Well new looking mobs require tons of new art

Fri Apr 27 00:47:58 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: Unless you just mean like humanoid mobs

Fri Apr 27 00:48:05 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: Like the NPC that carved the JoLs... but instead of giving him a pumpkin and getting a JoL... be able to give quest items, and get rewards.

Fri Apr 27 00:48:23 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: Yeah Ive already done something like that before should be easy

Fri Apr 27 00:48:28 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: We have 2 wandering questgivers now 

Fri Apr 27 00:49:50 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: I think.. I'm thinking humanoid mobs... like if I make a toon... can you copy his/her look.. and make them an interactive NPC where gold/mana are not the items accepted, but rather... the NPC 'talks' to players and tells them the quest item needed to be 

Fri Apr 27 00:50:20 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: turned in, so NPC can give them another item to be quested ... exchanged to another NPC.

Fri Apr 27 00:51:11 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: Where... what area(s) are the wandering quest-givers?

Fri Apr 27 00:51:25 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: They roam the whole world 

Fri Apr 27 00:51:32 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: In the wilderness

Fri Apr 27 00:51:37 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: Oooh.

Fri Apr 27 00:52:06 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: There are 2 of them, each takes a magical ruby/emerald

Fri Apr 27 00:52:18 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: The gems drop all over the world as well

Fri Apr 27 00:52:46 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: When turned in you get a bauble that grants 10 levels

Fri Apr 27 00:53:13 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: The world boss Xerxes wanders across the entire realm now too 

Fri Apr 27 00:53:19 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: He and Abaddon 

Fri Apr 27 00:53:23 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: Can walk through zone barriers

Fri Apr 27 00:53:29 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: 2 of each are up at any time

Fri Apr 27 00:53:36 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: 1 of each questgiver

Fri Apr 27 00:53:49 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: When killed, they will respawn into their special zone and leave it to a random zone

Fri Apr 27 00:54:49 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: Like, can you make a NPC, say.. 'Madrona', female shopkeeper that only does quests. Players can go to her to start a quest, and after completing said quest, can obtain a reward, that can either be kept or continue questing.

Fri Apr 27 00:55:11 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: I remember Xerxes... who is Abaddon?

Fri Apr 27 00:55:59 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: Slighty tougher fermale version

Fri Apr 27 00:56:23 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: fermale rofl

Fri Apr 27 00:56:24 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: female*

Fri Apr 27 00:57:07 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: I have some ideas for a seasonal event, and/or for advertising new Server... but I'm thinking more than the standard "word scrambles" and "riddles/amalgams".

Fri Apr 27 00:57:24 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: Fermale. How ferry is she?Üáá

Fri Apr 27 00:57:30 2018: zach:Zach:T RainBlossom: lolol

Fri Apr 27 00:57:35 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: LOL

Fri Apr 27 01:00:44 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: Let me write up some suggestions for a series of NPCs that give quests... we can take some old-school items, give them new names: Skon's Lunch, etc... and players can choose to quest for items..?

Fri Apr 27 01:03:26 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: <<gonna think up some names for new NPCs... semi-AFK.Ü

Fri Apr 27 03:35:39 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: Okay, I've done some research, and come up with some names for NPCs, and locations (township names) for them, but I haven't started thinking about possible quests/rewards yet.

Fri Apr 27 03:38:42 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: I wrote a little fictional synopsis of a storyline for a township, but need to select a couple of NPCs that could be tied into the new town: Harlowe, a site of a fierce battle that took place between the Dark forces and Light. 

Fri Apr 27 03:40:40 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: Dark elves recruited Dark faeries and trolls to destroy faeries of the Light Order, worshippers and protectors of Peace, Goodness, and Health.  Many a good faery had their wings mutilated, and their magic extinguished, for within their beautiful wings lie 

Fri Apr 27 03:41:31 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: the strength of their magic, as they perished by the hands of their evil cousins and siblings.

Fri Apr 27 03:45:58 2018: 35rr78bc:RainBlossom:T Zach: Anyway, I have to get to bed.. it's almost 1 am for me, and I have school @ 0715hrs. Å

Fri Apr 27 11:18:19 2018: heed1:Kakorot:G004: The Equalizer will assist the weilder in bringing peace to their land. Granting an additonal Attack as well as a boost to your Strength and Dexterity, this sword is sure to last long in battle.

Fri Apr 27 15:08:59 2018: heed1:Kakorot:G004: because all your items say s/d/ia/O and no PS/LS/ etc
Fri Apr 27 15:09:01 2018: shelldigger:CaptainAhab:G004: but it depends on what item Im replacing, and the chant thats on it, if that makes sense
Fri Apr 27 15:09:12 2018: shelldigger:CaptainAhab:G004: Umm the shield only has S/D i think
Fri Apr 27 15:09:21 2018: heed1:Kakorot:G004: you miss understand
Fri Apr 27 15:09:28 2018: heed1:Kakorot:G004: the chant shields not your shield

Fri Apr 27 15:10:40 2018: shelldigger:CaptainAhab:G004: having speed files makes figuring that out difficult if not impossible

Fri Apr 27 15:10:57 2018: heed1:Kakorot:G004: and it tells you

Mon May 14 22:18:44 2018: zach4:Hercules:G004: This server may not stick around
Mon May 14 22:19:06 2018: zach4:Hercules:G004: if nobody is interested or plays it Ill just remove it, no sense in it taking up resoueces if nobody plays
